### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I am slowly getting a better understanding of all the background styling rules, I think I managed to get a decent result even though it doesnt exactly react like I would want it to.

I had fun with the challenge, especially with the storage "progress bar" making it responsive and adding the white dot was interesting.
